# The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Get-Started-in-Data-Science

## Data Science
Data Science is a multi-disciplinary field that make use of mathematical methods,processes,systems 
and algorothms to extract knowledge or business intelligence from structured or unstructured data.

also,Data Science is a study of data, where you maintain datsets and derive insights from the dataset.
Data Science uses different parts mentioned in the pattern below to solve the problems

## Data Science involves:

®Storing and Collecting data

®Cleaning and Exploring data

®Visualizing Data

®Preparing the data to be ready for implementation of machine learning models


## some basic terminology used in data science:

-Observations - data points in your dataset (rows)

-Features - variables in your dataset (columns)

-Target Variable - which you are trying to predict

-Train data - data from which your algorithm learns

-Test data - data to evaluate your model performance

-Model - set of patterns learned from the data

-Algorithm - specific machine learning process used to train your model


## What do you need to know to be a successful data scientist?

1.Programming Knowledge

2.Data modelling and evaluation

3.Data Visualization and reporting

4.Probability and Statistics

5.Machine Learning techniques

6.Relational Database knowledge


## Some of the Python libraries are :

-Numpy

-Scipy 

-Scikit-learn

-Pandas

-TensorFlow 

-PyTorch



I am also quite new to Data Science and Machine learning world but I have 
been spending some time to understand this field and have done some research in terms 
of the best resources to learn machine learning, data science, etc.
Here is my list of some of the best courses to learn Data Science, 
Machine learning, and deep learning using Python and R programming language

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)

Kaggle is a leading online data science community. They offer many online courses, 
and their courses are geared towards beginners and intermediate learners. 
The Kaggle course “Introduction to Data Science” is a great place to start. 
This course will teach you the basics of data science, including data analysis, 
data visualization, and machine learning. You will also learn how to use the 
R programming language for data analysis.

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)

The Coursera Data Science Specialization is a comprehensive data science 
course that is perfect for beginners. This 10-course specialization covers 
data science basics, including data exploration, data visualization, data modeling, 
and machine learning. It teaches you how to use the R programming language to analyze data
 and how to use Tableau to create data visualizations.

[Harvard](https://pll.harvard.edu/series/professional-certificate-data-science)

The Harvard Data Science Professional Certificate is a comprehensive data science 
course that is perfect for beginners. This course will teach you how to use data 
to solve business problems. You will learn how to collect, clean, and analyze data 
to find trends and insights. You will also learn how to use data to make better decisions and predictions.
